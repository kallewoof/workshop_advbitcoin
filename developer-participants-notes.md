* optional: Have a testing hardwarewallet, one of coldcard, Specter-DIY or any other compatible HWI-compatible hardwarewallet

# Setup (Kim)
Goal and intermediate steps:
* Run the software in development-mode (modifyable sources immediately detected) without a bitcoincore on port 25441
* Creating a device based on Specter-DIY
* a docker-running-regtest-bitcoind, configuring in specter-desktop
* Create a two simple wallets, get them coins funded, send a coin from one wallet to the other (regtest)
* Run the tests:
  * on the commandline, choose file and specific test
  * On the IDE run all the tests or soecific ones
* Add breakpoints and debug the tests
* Add breakpoints and debug the application (port 5000)

# Setup hardware-hacking (Stepan)
* Download the firmware from somewhere and deploy on hardware


# Coinselection (Kim)

* Investigate current aspects relevant to coinselection
* Think and define the different steps to implement
* Implement list on UI
* adjust controller (test?!)
