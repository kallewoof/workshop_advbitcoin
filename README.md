# Purpose
We'll have two workshops on the Advancing Bitcoin Conference in London:
* One is focussing on (power-) users which can give us feedback and are multiplicators to increase our reach
* The other one is focused on Developers, both specter-diy and specter-desktop

For each workshop, we'll create two documents:
* the participants-notes which we'll later copy to a public gist for use of the participants.
* the internal-notes which is not intended for publishing
