# Purpose (to be removed)
We'll have two workshops on the Advancing Bitcoin Conference in London:
* One is focussing on (power-) users which can give us feedback and are multiplicators to increase our reach
* The other one is focused on Developers, both specter-diy and specter-desktop

For each workshop, we'll create two folders which contains problem and solution in seperated files.
We probably don't have seperated "trainer-notes".
