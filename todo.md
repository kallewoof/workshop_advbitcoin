hardware:

- deploy https://app.specterwallet.io with autofill of wallets
- make sure psbt has final_scriptsig
- go through the whole workshop from scratch once with the timer
- prepare the boards
- prepare custom specter build that "just runs in dev mode"
- write text description for chapters
- move Setup to main readme, not individual workshop files
- solder battaries
- tests - maybe unittests instead of integration

- preorder page?
- cancel scan button doesn't work anymore

- maybe_create_default_wallets() - then we can assign a task to it
