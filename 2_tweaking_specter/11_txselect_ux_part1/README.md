## Hide UI (extended functionality) with vue.js
* The selection of coins should only be an optional feature. That means that we should hide the functionality and only open it up if needed.
* So let's do a toggling of the feature and collapse by default and use vue.js in order to do that

Hints:
* Add the script-tag to include the vue.js file
* Specify your Vue-js application in another script-tag. Check the crashcourse-example for the needed code
* Add a data-section and a method which changes the data when called
* bind the visibility of the surrounding div to the data
* bind the click of the button to the method you created above
